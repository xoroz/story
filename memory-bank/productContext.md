# Product Context

3. Can be customized to include familiar elements (characters, settings) that resonate with the child
4. Are available in multiple languages to support diverse families
5. Include audio narration for children who are still developing reading skills

StoryMagic addresses these challenges by providing an AI-powered platform that generates personalized, educational stories on demand.
