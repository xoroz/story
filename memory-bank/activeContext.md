# Active Context

## Current Focus


## Brainstorm ideas, improvements
 - we need to improve the story audio: ( story_process.py ) 
   1. more engaging with sounds and different voices, with rich voice content
 maybe we should try elevenlabs ?  
   2. maybe by creating a poetic form story ? 
   3. maybe by using crewai and create a whole ai agents to go full blown, story, audio,images, pdf etc..
 - we need multilanguage options 4 lang only for now ( app.py ) 
 - we need engaging form compilation , full out new chatbot audio converstation with the child user, to compile
 the needed json file for the backend ( vertical change no changes on existing code, but new external optionl like vertificalshift ? )
 - we need new addon github external auth option 
 - we need overhaul entire app for production deployment:
  1. change from flask web server to prod options fine tune for heavy load (config browser cache static, and webserver ram cahce static content)
  2. security checks before going to prod, limit forms max input chars, defend for input buffers
  3. create robots.txt to index on google and others
  4. setup all its need for SEO web search highest standard
  - we need to auto export/publish on different plataforms like spotify channel/ youtube channel / x.com , we would need one channel per language, this could be a complex task and we must do one plataform at a time.
  - once we have 50 users, we should start adding payment method and allow payment via paypal only to start with credits then monthly subscriptions
  - we will need to convert the webapp into android app

Login Enhancement Completed
I've successfully implemented the ability to log in using either username or email. Here's what was changed:

1. Updated Login Form
Changed the form label from "Username:" to "Username/Email:" in the login template
Added proper translation markers for multilanguage support
2. Modified Authentication Logic
Updated the login route in auth.py to check for matches in both username and email fields
The SQL query now uses WHERE username = ? OR email = ? to allow either type of credential
Updated the error message to reflect the new login options
Fixed the import for the translation function to use from flask_babel import gettext as _
3. Updated Client-Side Validation
Modified the JavaScript validation in auth.js to use a more appropriate variable name
The validation still ensures both fields are filled before submission
4. Added Multilanguage Support
Added translations for "Username/Email:" and the updated error message in:
Spanish: "Usuario/Email:" and "Usuario/email o contraseña inválidos."
Portuguese: "Usuário/Email:" and "Usuário/email ou senha inválidos."
Italian: "Nome utente/Email:" and "Nome utente/email o password non validi."

- improve the create story form, we need to limit input chars on title and Main Characters  to 40.
lets create a random button on the very top to fill entire form with 8 random, pre-created and defined inside config.ini under [App] example_stories It should be able to populate all fields!

## Current Issues
- story list while not login is showing also private ones! if story is set private it should never be displayed to everyone, but only to the owner of the story.
- waiting page is not rotating the message , it should rotate current text "check waiting_waiting.js we need to create an entry in the config.ini under [app] with name "waiting_messages" with 8 different messages to have the user attention so we load the story in the background. it must update this part of the waiting.html <div class="status-message"> <p>Please wait while we generate your story...</p>    </div> s

## Debugging Strategy

### Database Integration
- Use db_utils.log to track database operations and identify issues
- Test process_stories.py with various JSON files to ensure robust handling
- Verify privacy settings are correctly applied in story listing and viewing
- Check for any performance issues with the hybrid storage approach

### Authentication System
- Ensure database is properly initialized before any authentication operations
- Use debug print statements to track route access and form submissions
- Verify session management for logged-in users
- Test credit system functionality

### Admin Dashboard
- Update admin dashboard to display and filter by user information
- Add ability to manage user privacy settings from admin interface
